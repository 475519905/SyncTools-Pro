SyncTools for Cinema 4D
Supported Range

Sync Tools supports bidirectional import and export of the following 3D resource types: characters, animations, splines, materials, models, cameras, lights, and project settings.

Plugin Introduction
Are you tired of frequently switching between different 3D software, handling repetitive tasks, and wasting valuable time on complex operations? Sync Tools is designed to optimize your workflow and simplify the 3D design process.

As a tool centered on efficiency and productivity, it can significantly enhance your daily work experience, making your life as a 3D artist easier.

Try “SyncTools Pro" now—it will change the way you work in Cinema 4D and Blender.

Are These Scenarios Killing Your Creativity?
❌ Wasting hours manually aligning scales/axes when transferring assets between Blender and Cinema 4D
❌ Rendering disasters from mismatched frame rates or resolution settings across software
❌ Rebuilding complex Octane/Redshift material nodes from scratch after every migration
❌ Animation curves mangled beyond recognition, forcing frame-by-frame fixes

Main Features
1. Quick Copy and Paste
Seamlessly transfer objects between C4D and Blender with just one click. No need to manually adjust cumbersome scales, axes, or hierarchy structures. Save a significant amount of time and focus on what truly matters—your creative vision.

2. Automatic Synchronization of Core Project Parameters
Automatically sync core project parameters, including focal length, resolution, image aspect ratio, and frame rate. Ensure consistent project settings across different software, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of your cross-platform workflow.

3. Extensive Material Support
The plugin covers material import and export for almost all mainstream renderers, including Octane, Redshift, . It also supports the import and export of material selection sets.

4. Lighting Support
When importing lights, Sync Tools accurately restores their intensity, automatically generates corresponding light nodes and tags, and retains the lights' color and texture information.

5. Complete Animation Support
The plugin supports animation import, fully preserving keyframes and curve handles to ensure lossless animation precision.

6. Continuous Optimization and Updates
Sync Tools is continuously being optimized and upgraded. All users can upgrade to the latest version for free.

7. Persistent Import and Export Functionality
Even after closing the software following export or import operations, the plugin can continue to use the import and export features normally.
